12.10.15
- Added move description.

04.10.15
- Completed the gui. Still to add move description, mouse input and show opponent's moves (last 2 not mandatory).

02.10.15
- Perfected self simulator.

01.10.15
- Made a self simulator and improved ds simulator.
- Added Master Beautiful contest team builder.

30.09.15
- Made more simulations, started to write self-simulation script so that it matters the DS simulations.

29.09.15
- Implemented a lot of elements of gui.

25.09.15
- Changed simulation reward from wins to tothearts to tothearts + tothearts of worst player (better for DS simulations was last one).

23.09.15
- Improved simulations to make automatically a csv file.

21.09.15
- Tried to implement random chance in tree, not good results.

18.09.15
- Added coroutines to make AI thinking in background and to show progress of thinking.
- Added history display.

17.09.15
- Added move hint for human player based on MCTS and difficulty choice, and added tree display.
- Made a command line program to do simulations.

15.09.15
- Added randomchoices to set already decided random outcomes.

13.09.15
- Created a function to display the game tree made by the algorithm.

12.09.15
- Adjusted timing.
- Commented main.lua for gui.
- Experimented on how to implement threads.

11.09.15
- Added move selection for one Pok√©mon.

10.09.15
- Made an animated interface, still to be improved.

05.09.15
- Review some texts in the interface.

02.09.15
- Started to implement graphical interface.

29.08.15
- Implemented new move types: 21half.
- Started to implement contest events and interface (Italian). Good point reached.
- Implemented combo moves.

28.08.15
- Implemented new move types: 20betterlast, 80suicide, 44cantmove, 30nextlast, 30noboring.
- Chosen a moveset for Jigglypuff.

27.08.15
- Started to think what to do to make a user interface.
- Rethought the move type identifiers (not number but strings). e.g. In "12effect" +1 is base appeal, -2 is base jam, effect is a synthesis of what it does.
- Implemented new move types: 10random, 10copy, 30first, 60easy, 30excite, 30prev, 20nervous, 20sametype.

25.08.15+26.08.15
- Made tests to estimate probability of nervousness and for 10random.

24.08.15
- Revision of code to add comments.

23.08.15
- Revision of code for making tests on win rate.
- Made tests on win rate: MCTS-1000 vs 3 random players (with same moves) wins more than 50%. The algorithm works well!
