--[[
The problem is that contests are not completely sequential: in fact, the choice and actuation of moves is simultaneous.
This class is made to treat contest as completely sequential games: in fact, you can just say to ContestState (CS) to make a player perform a move, than CS deals with queueing all the moves and, when it has four of them, it executes a turn.
So thanks to this class we trasform a mixed sequential-simultaneous game into a full sequential game, that we can use to make a game tree.
