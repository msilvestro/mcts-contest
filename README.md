# MCTS Contest Thesis Project

![Simulation screenshot](img/tri_contest.png)

My bachelor's thesis, **MCTS e videogiochi: un'applicazione per le Gare Pokémon
Live**, was an amusing and almost reckless adventure, but in the end the results
were very interesting and promising. Furthermore, I succeeded in combining
Pokémon with mathematics, and I'm quite proud of that.

This is the simulation software that I used in my thesis, which you can read
following the links below.

All reading material is written in Italian.
